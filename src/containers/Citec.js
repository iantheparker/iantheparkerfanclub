        <a href={links.citec_url}>CitEc: Citations in Economics</a> lives up to
        its name as a massive database for citations in economics. I'm
        collaborating with a Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University,
        Dr. Aboozar Hadavand, to examine how subconscious bias impacts what
        ideas get spotlighted. Using data from CitEc, we are analyzing citations
        across an economistâ€™s lifetime and seeing how this varies by their
        gender and institution.
        <a href={links.pdf}> You can see our initial proposal here</a>, but plan
        to finish our first paper on the topic before spring 2019.
