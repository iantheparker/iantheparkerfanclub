        <a href={links.frame_url}>Frame.ai</a> is a startup delivering analytics
        on CRM exchanges. I researched the accuracy of FastAIâ€™s ULMFiT in
        low-data regimes and <a href={links.blog}> wrote a blog post</a> about
        it with Jesse St. Charles at Frame.

        Great to see folks doing additional ablation experiments beyond those we
        already did in the ULMFiT paper. This work shows that even just a little
        unlabeled data helps a lot!

        Did you see that? Jeremy Howard from FastAI rewteeted and complemented
        our work! Jesse had the vision and the research experience, I had spent
        more time with FastAI's library and FloydHub's services, so I
        kickstarted the <a href={links.source}>GitHub repo</a> and blog post.
        Jesse perfected it and guaranteed that our science was rigorous!
