        Tumbleweed was an experiment in location-based content I worked on in 2012. I teamed up with
        UX designers <a href={links.greg}>Greg Kuebler</a> and <a href={links.luke}>Luke Miller</a>{' '}
        to toy with the question of whether a story could be better told by taking into account
        where the audience was currently standing.

        I had recently co-directed a short film called No Manâ€™s Land, and we came up with the idea
        of transforming it into a location-based game. We used a few different interactions:
        check-in to a nearby venue in Foursquare, so say for instance the next scene takes place at
        a saloon, you'd have to be near a similar category like a bar. Also, some scenes required
        leaving town or a several mile radius, and some scenes just unlocked when enough time had
        passed. Kuebler managed the design assets, I handled the software, and{' '}
        <a href={links.kletsel}>Greg Kletsel</a> illustrated.
